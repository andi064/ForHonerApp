                        <p>It is strongly recommended that you take screenshots of all your scoreboards in case of a dispute. The default key for Uplay is F12. For the best match security you should stream or record your tournament run. Admin decisions are final.</p>

                        <h5>Contacting Admins</h5>
                        <p>The primary way to contact an admin for support is with the 'Report Match Issue' button and the private chat on your Battlefy match page. For extra help you may also contact an admin in the Discord.</p>
                        <h5>Disconnects</h5>
                        <p>Each team is allowed 1 DC/bug/crash restart within the first minute of each map. The same map/heroes must be played in case of a restart but you may switch out a disconnecting player for a sub. 
                                For disconnects after the first minute you may try re-inviting a disconnected player through the Uplay overlay mid-game. If this does not work you must play out the Map with a bot. </p>
                        <h5>Match Crashes/Splits</h5>
                        <p>If the entire map crashes/splits and a single team is breaking, or there is a RAW 100 point (discluding the +100 from objectives), the leading team wins the map (provide screenshots in Discord for admin confirmation). If neither team has such an advantage, remake with the same map/heroes with a 10 minute time limit.
                                If teams cannot connect to each other we may have to DQ both teams to keep the tournament moving forward</p>
                        <h5>Tournament CheckIn</h5>
                        <p>All players are required to check in on Battlefy at the start of the tournament to confirm you still wish to compete. Check in starts 30 minutes before match start time. If you do not check in on time you will not be added into the bracket. Brackets will not be redrawn.</p>
                        <h5>Match Check In Timer</h5>
                        <p>Teams will be asked to check in to each match. Once they do, if their opponents do not check in within the allotted time (10 minutes), the team that checked in will automatically get the win for the match and their opponents will be dropped from the tournament. Players must be present, have the latest game version installed, and have their hardware prepared at this time. If your opponents are checked in but are not ready to play within 10 minutes of the match start time please contact an admin.</p>
                        <h5>Roster</h5>
                        <p>All players must be declared as part of the team before check in.Team captains will be the main point of contact for tournament staff. Please change your Discord Nickname to your Uplay/Gamertag on the day of the tournament for smoother matchmaking and communication. Captains will be expected to remain in the Discord server for the duration of the tournament. A team may have up to 2 sub players as in case of disconnects or drop outs. These players must be registered to the team on Battlefy.If a player is replaced by a sub, they are replaced for the entire match.</p>
                        <h5>Lobies and Hosting</h5>
                        <p>The team captain from the top side of the bracket is responsible for adding the opposing captain on Uplay, inviting the opposing captain, and selecting the correct match settings. If both teams agree then either team can create the lobby. If players are having issues inviting each other, restart all Uplay clients and try again. If you are still having connection problems contact a tournament admin on Discord.If both teams still cannot connect to each other we may have to DQ both teams to keep the tournament moving forward.</p>
                        <h5>Bugs/Tech</h5>
                        <p>Due to the immense difficulty in policing bug use in on online tournament with simultaneous matches and their lowered effectiveness in team modes, it is likely that all tech available in the live game will be considered legal. Note: The Season 3 patch notes state that Nobushi's Cobra Strike and Sidewinder unlocks have been fixed.</p>

                            <p>Disputes submitted by those who are NOT team captains will be ignored. Disputes must be submitted with evidence to support the claim, examples are:</p>
                            <li>Wrong results (EG: screenshot of score screen)</li>
                            <li>Wrong game settings (screenshot)</li>

                        <h5>Admins and Referees</h5>
                        <p>All participants must adhere to the decisions and rules of the tournament organizers, admins, and referees. All decisions are final. Conversations, either verbal or written, between organizers, admins, or referees, and participants are confidential. Publicly posting or sharing these conversations with outside parties is strictly forbidden, unless permission is obtained</p>
                        <h5>Content Request</h5>
                        <p>It would be much appreciated if video game capture such as shadow play or sharing options on console was enabled. If you have a cool clip be sure upload to youtube or any other video service as public or unlisted and send a link to the clip to /u/Dashu16 on reddit or email him directly with a link at Dashu16@gmail.com . Footage will be condensed to highlight moments and other content of the best/worst/funniest plays of the tournament. Please include time stamps.</p>
